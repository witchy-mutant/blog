summary: "I love conferences and I love Łódź, that's why I'm helping to organise GET.NET Łódź 2017."

I love conferences. Attending them, speaking at them and organising them. I feel addicted to the atmosphere of *the fest*. Talking to other like-minded people, sharing our knowledge and experience, feeling the vibe of the community.

I also love Łódź, I lived there for 6 years. This is one of the most interesting cities in Poland and I love coming back.

So, that's why I am so happy to be helping to organise [GET.NET Łódź 2017](https://konferencjaget.net/en/lodz)!

I was a speaker at this conference in 2014, I helped a little in 2015, and now I'm returning with responsibility for this year's Łódź edition programme.

I would like to invite you to this great conference; it's happening on the 22nd of April and the team of organisers is doing everything it can to make it a real dev fest!

If you feel like sharing your knowledge with others, the Call For Papers is opening very soon! It should be announced [on the official conference website](https://konferencjaget.net/en/lodz).

I honestly hope to see you and talk to you in Łódź at #GETNET.

*Perhaps you'd also like to run [a marathon, or maybe 10k](http://www.lodzmaraton.pl/), the next day? :)*
